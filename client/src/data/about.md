# Problem Addressed

## Goal 16 UN SDG's

Using this project we can make an impact on every sdg's as the goals are majorly influenced by the political governance in a country.
And, acting on those issues can make an positive impact to the society and help in achieving the SDG's.

Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

## Problem
The socio-economic-environmental challenges that we face today are mostly influenced by the working of the government / ruling party.

Issues like drainage blockage, garbage collection, landfills, pollution, no safe water, house/property issues, unemployment, poor education quality or any other surrounding environment issues, etc. comes majorly under their respective departments that run on people's money.

### Social Media Influence

- In this, social media influence plays a major role leading to misunderstandings, false data and reports.
- Also constant display of false fame leads to misconceptions that a particular party is doing very good work even though nothing is achieved.
- Often such influence does not focus on the major underlying issues or the main issue at all, they tend to differentiate and diverge to an entirely different or non-existent issues.
- Social media baisness can be seen very clearly through television, media, entertainment, actors, etc. The youth when exposed to such false influence tends to a follow such idols.


## Solution

The very first step of problem solving is problem analysis, that most of the political parties and government appears (not sure) to be skipping.

The **Project Truth** focusses mainly on problem analysis step.

The project intends to bring real data without any biasness towards a particular political party / officers / government to all the people.

Consider this as a **public initiative** where people can:

1. Raise an issue against a political leader, department, officer or a concern/appeal via application.

2. The user may also suggest some solutions and importantance and advantages of resolving the issue.

3. The statistics of this issues collected can be displayed over map and thoroughly analysed by everyone.

4. The user can then verify if that particular issue is resolved or not.

5. The entire system works on data privacy policy the users info is not shared nor used for any other things except verification.

6. The system then shows the abstracted issues (issues which are refined with no user data involved) to everyone so as to measure the performance of a political party over a region and time.

Now the people can directly consider the statistics and get a **quantitative term to measure the performance** of the government / political party.

## Advantages

1. Truth, trust and transperency increases with the working of the government.

2. Government can also take advantage of such data and act on areas with major problems quickly.

3. More people gets involved in the working of the government. This gives people more power over problem solving in real life.

4. More people can help in resolution of a common issues.

5. Useful in measuring the performance or feseability of the government / political party.

6. More clear and concise understand of the progress / development in the country.

7. Better and more efficient solutions might come up if multiple people suggests.

8. What actions have been taken, their positive and negative effects can be monitored by the government as well as people and improved furthur.

## Current Limitations

1. Verification is dependent on the government support. [In India, the mostly used digital user identification is Aadhar UID. The verification of user through Aadhar requires permits.]

2. Data security: As a developer to display a prototype working, the user verification is done via email. No user data will be used for any purposes. Account and Data deletion is always available. To understand more see, Developers - Data Security.

3. Platform development: More tools can be added to enhance user experience and for advanced data analysis. To contribute to the project see, Developers - GitHub.
